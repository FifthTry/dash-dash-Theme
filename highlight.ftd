The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the String is currently
 using. The capacity is the total amount of {highlight: memory}, in bytes, that the String 
 has received from the allocator. The difference between length and capacity 
 matters, but not in this context, so for now, itâ€™s fine to ignore the capacity.
When we assign s1 to s2, the String data is copied, meaning we copy the pointer,
 the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the data on 
 the heap that the pointer refers to. In other words, the data representation 
 in memory looks like Figure 4-2.
